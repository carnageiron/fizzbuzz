## Program Description

FizzBuzz is a classic programming exercise often used as an interview question. The program prints numbers from 1 to a given limit, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz", numbers divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz", and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "FizzBuzz". For example, when the limit is set to 15, the program will produce the following output:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

This repository contains a simple implementation of the FizzBuzz program using Python.

## Installation

To run the FizzBuzz program locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carnageiron/fizzbuzz.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd fizzbuzz
```

3. Ensure you have Python installed. The program is compatible with Python 3.

## Usage

To execute the FizzBuzz program, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd fizzbuzz
```

2. Run the Python script using the following command:

```bash
python fizzbuzz.py
```

3. You will be prompted to enter the upper limit for the FizzBuzz sequence. Enter a positive integer and press Enter.

4. The program will generate the FizzBuzz sequence and print it to the console.

## Testing

Unit tests have been included to verify the correctness of the FizzBuzz implementation. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory.

2. Run the test script using the following command:

```bash
python test_fizzbuzz.py
```

3. The test results will be displayed in the console, indicating whether all tests passed or if there were any failures.
